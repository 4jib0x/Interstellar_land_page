# Interstellar - Landing Page

A visually captivating and responsive landing page inspired by Christopher Nolan's cinematic masterpiece, *Interstellar*. This project is a tribute to the film, built with modern web technologies and a focus on creating an immersive user experience.

This project was also a significant learning milestone, as it was my first complete project utilizing the **Bootstrap 5** framework. A great deal of effort was dedicated to ensuring the design is **highly responsive**, especially on mobile devices.
