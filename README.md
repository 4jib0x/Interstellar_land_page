# Interstellar - Landing Page

A visually captivating and responsive landing page inspired by Christopher Nolan's cinematic masterpiece, *Interstellar*. This project is a tribute to the film, built with modern web technologies and a focus on creating an immersive user experience.

This project was also a significant learning milestone, as it was my first complete project utilizing the **Bootstrap 5** framework. A great deal of effort was dedicated to ensuring the design is **highly responsive**, especially on mobile devices.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Fully Responsive Design:** The layout seamlessly adapts to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops, with special attention given to the mobile experience.
*   **Bilingual Support (EN / AR):** The entire page is available in both English and Arabic, with a simple UI to switch between them.
*   **Interactive Components:** Utilizes Bootstrap components like the Navbar, Carousel, and Modal to create an engaging and interactive user interface.
*   **Modern & Clean UI:** Built with Bootstrap 5 for a robust, consistent, and modern layout.
*   **Dynamic Content:** JavaScript is used to handle language changes, update the copyright year automatically, and manage the trailer modal.

## üåç Internationalization (i18n)

One of the key features of this project is its support for multiple languages.

*   **Language Switcher:** A simple button group in the navigation bar allows users to switch between **English (EN)** and **Arabic (AR)**.
*   **Dynamic Text:** All text content is managed through a JavaScript dictionary, allowing for easy updates and translations.
*   **RTL/LTR Support:** The page layout correctly switches between Left-to-Right (LTR) for English and Right-to-Left (RTL) for Arabic by dynamically changing the `dir` attribute on the HTML tag and loading the appropriate Bootstrap RTL stylesheet.
*   **State Persistence:** The selected language is saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so the user's preference is remembered on their next visit.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the page.
*   **CSS3:** For custom styling, animations, and creating the unique visual atmosphere.
*   **JavaScript (ES6):** For interactivity, language switching, and dynamic content manipulation.
*   **Bootstrap 5:** As the primary CSS framework for layout, components, and responsiveness.
